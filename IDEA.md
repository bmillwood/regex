# Interactive Regex Explainer (Regexplainer?)

There are a lot of tools for inspection of regular expressions 
that I feel don't usually get explored. For example, for a 
given regular expression and input string, you can easily 
answer questions like:

* what characters does the regex permit to appear next?
* which parts of the input string match which parts of the
regular expression?
* what are some examples of complete matching strings?
