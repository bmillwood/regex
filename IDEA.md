# Interactive Regex Explainer (Regexplainer?)

## Feature roadmap

In order of when I plan to tackle them:

* An English explanation of the meaning of the regex.
* A way to assemble a regex from an English explanation.
* Listing the first (say) 10 matches.
* For a partial match, showing which part of the regex matched
which part of the input.
* For a partial match, showing some possible continuations of
the match.
